## Octave docset
### Octave documentation as Dash docset

[Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a programming language for matrix mathematical calculations. It is very similar to [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.de/products/matlab/) and its syntax is almost interchangable. I use Octave at university for _Machine Learning_ and _Speech Processing_ calculations.

[Dash](kapeli.com/dash) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager for Mac. If you are using Windows or Linux you probably want to have a look at [Zeal](http://zealdocs.org/) which is quite similar to Dash.

#### Installation Dash

Just download this [docset](https://github.com/obstschale/octave-docset/archive/master.zip) and unzip it. To install it just double-click on `octave.docset` and Dash will add this docset.

#### Installation Zeal (Windows)

To manually install a docket in Zeal you need to download the [docset](https://github.com/obstschale/octave-docset/archive/master.zip) and copy the docset-folder into `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\zeal\docset\`. Restart Zeal and Octave should be loaded automatically.
